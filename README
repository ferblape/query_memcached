= QueryMemcached

http://github.com/ferblape/query_memcached

== Install

In the root directory of your project:

script/plugin install git://github.com/ferblape/query_memcached.git

If you want to install it like a module you can follow this post, adapting the URLs to this plugin:

http://woss.name/2008/04/09/using-git-submodules-to-track-vendorrails/

== Requirements

  - Rails >= 2.1
  - memcache-client gem (maybe it will work also in memcached gem by fauna, see below)
  - MySQL (I don't have tested this plugin in another DB Engine)

== Description

This plugin tries to replace ActiveRecord query_cache, adding a Memcache layer for persistence of the query's cache between requests. 

It is, instead of saving all the SQL query's results in memory each request you save them into Memcached, so you have them all the time.

For expiring this cache, each Memcached key contains a sumatory of all the version numbers of the tables involved in the query. If one of that tables is modified, then the version number for that table is increased.

For example, the query below involves the table items and the table places:

  SELECT * from items INNER JOIN places ON places.item_id = item.id WHERE (item.created_at >= '2008-02-02 00:00:00')

The idea behind this is way of create and expire cache was inspired by the post The Secret to Memcached [http://blog.leetsoft.com/2007/5/22/the-secret-to-memcached] by Tobias LÃ¼tke.

For this plugin to work it's supposed that your ActionController cache store configured is mem_cache_store. In not the plugin will not allow your application to start, raising an exception.

== Problems

The main problem nowadays is that it doesn't detect table names from nested querys. So if your application has nested SQL querys please, don't use this plugin.

=== TODO

There is a list of pending features, bugs, and so on in a file named TODO.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome.

== Another comments

It's so easy to adapt the plugin for Rails version 2.0.2 if you change the cache variable for another instantiated with the memcache-client.

Also, it is possible to run in Rails >= 1.2.4 if you change the plugin query_cache [http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/query_cache] with the changes of query_memcached.

== Special Thanks
