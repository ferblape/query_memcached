= Running tests

For testing this plugin I decided to adapt a the query cache tests' from ActiveRecord. 

First of all you have to know that there is a Rails 2.1 application in `test/testing_app`.

So you need a database as indicated in `config/database.yml`:

  user: root
  adapter: mysql
  database: 'activerecord_unittest'
  encoding: utf8
  
Then, load the schema from `db/schema.rb`
