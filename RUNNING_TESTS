= Running tests

For testing this plugin I decided to adapt a the query cache tests from ActiveRecord. 

First of all you have to know that there is a Rails 2.1 application in test/testing_app. This application contains a lot of models. AR test suite has been converted to the Unit Tests of this application.

So you need a database as indicated in config/database.yml:

  user: root
  adapter: mysql
  database: 'activerecord_unittest'
  encoding: utf8
  
And also a memcached running in the standar port (11211).

Then, load the schema from db/schema.rb and run

  rake test:units

That's all.
