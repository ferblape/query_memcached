= Running tests

For testing this plugin I decided to adapt a big subset of ActiveRecord test suite in order to test if all those test run ok with the plugin activated.

The main reason is because this plugin affects in a very deeper way the communication with the database. AR tests are very complete, and test everything concerned to the database: reads, updates, deletes, reads in relationships, creations through relations, etc

That's why the test suite of this plugin is so different.

First of all you have to know that there is a Rails 2.1 application in test/testing_app. This application contains a lot of models. AR test suite has been converted to the Unit Tests of this application.

So you need a database as indicated in config/database.yml:

  user: root
  adapter: mysql
  database: 'activerecord_unittest'
  encoding: utf8

Then, load the schema from db/schema.rb and run

  rake test:units

That's all.
